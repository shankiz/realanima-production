Disabling rules
If you would like to modify or disable any rules provided by the supported plugins (react, react-hooks, next), you can directly change them using the rules property in your .eslintrc:

eslint.config.mjs

import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
 
const compat = new FlatCompat({
  // import.meta.dirname is available after Node.js v20.11.0
  baseDirectory: import.meta.dirname,
})
 
const eslintConfig = [
  ...compat.config({
    extends: ['next'],
    rules: {
      'react/no-unescaped-entities': 'off',
      '@next/next/no-page-custom-font': 'off',
    },
  }),
]
 
export default eslintConfig
With Core Web Vitals
The next/core-web-vitals rule set is enabled when next lint is run for the first time and the strict option is selected.

eslint.config.mjs

import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
 
const compat = new FlatCompat({
  // import.meta.dirname is available after Node.js v20.11.0
  baseDirectory: import.meta.dirname,
})
 
const eslintConfig = [
  ...compat.config({
    extends: ['next/core-web-vitals'],
  }),
]
 
export default eslintConfig
next/core-web-vitals updates eslint-plugin-next to error on a number of rules that are warnings by default if they affect Core Web Vitals.

The next/core-web-vitals entry point is automatically included for new applications built with Create Next App.

With TypeScript
In addition to the Next.js ESLint rules, create-next-app --typescript will also add TypeScript-specific lint rules with next/typescript to your config:

eslint.config.mjs

import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
 
const compat = new FlatCompat({
  // import.meta.dirname is available after Node.js v20.11.0
  baseDirectory: import.meta.dirname,
})
 
const eslintConfig = [
  ...compat.config({
    extends: ['next/core-web-vitals', 'next/typescript'],
  }),
]
 
export default eslintConfig
Those rules are based on plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended. See typescript-eslint > Configs for more details.

With Prettier
ESLint also contains code formatting rules, which can conflict with your existing Prettier setup. We recommend including eslint-config-prettier in your ESLint config to make ESLint and Prettier work together.

First, install the dependency:

Terminal

npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
 
yarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier
 
pnpm add --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
 
bun add --dev eslint-config-prettier
Then, add prettier to your existing ESLint config:

eslint.config.mjs

import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
 
const compat = new FlatCompat({
  // import.meta.dirname is available after Node.js v20.11.0
  baseDirectory: import.meta.dirname,
})
 
const eslintConfig = [
  ...compat.config({
    extends: ['next', 'prettier'],
  }),
]
 
export default eslintConfig
Running lint on staged files
If you would like to use next lint with lint-staged to run the linter on staged git files, you'll have to add the following to the .lintstagedrc.js file in the root of your project in order to specify usage of the --file flag.

.lintstagedrc.js

const path = require('path')
 
const buildEslintCommand = (filenames) =>
  `next lint --fix --file ${filenames
    .map((f) => path.relative(process.cwd(), f))
    .join(' --file ')}`
 
module.exports = {
  '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}': [buildEslintCommand],
}
Disabling linting during production builds
If you do not want ESLint to run during next build, you can set the eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds option in next.config.js to true:

next.config.ts
TypeScript

TypeScript

import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
 
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    // Warning: This allows production builds to successfully complete even if
    // your project has ESLint errors.
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
}
 
export default nextConfig
Migrating existing config
If you already have ESLint configured in your application, we recommend extending from this plugin directly instead of including eslint-config-next unless a few conditions are met.

Recommended plugin ruleset
If the following conditions are true:

You have one or more of the following plugins already installed (either separately or through a different config such as airbnb or react-app):
react
react-hooks
jsx-a11y
import
You've defined specific parserOptions that are different from how Babel is configured within Next.js (this is not recommended unless you have customized your Babel configuration)
You have eslint-plugin-import installed with Node.js and/or TypeScript resolvers defined to handle imports
Then we recommend either removing these settings if you prefer how these properties have been configured within eslint-config-next or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin instead:


module.exports = {
  extends: [
    //...
    'plugin:@next/next/recommended',
  ],
}
The plugin can be installed normally in your project without needing to run next lint:

Terminal

npm install --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next
 
yarn add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next
 
pnpm add --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next
 
bun add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next
This eliminates the risk of collisions or errors that can occur due to importing the same plugin or parser across multiple configurations.

Additional configurations
If you already use a separate ESLint configuration and want to include eslint-config-next, ensure that it is extended last after other configurations. For example:

eslint.config.mjs

import js from '@eslint/js'
import { FlatCompat } from '@eslint/eslintrc'
 
const compat = new FlatCompat({
  // import.meta.dirname is available after Node.js v20.11.0
  baseDirectory: import.meta.dirname,
  recommendedConfig: js.configs.recommended,
})
 
const eslintConfig = [
  ...compat.config({
    extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'next'],
  }),
]
 
export default eslintConfig
The next configuration already handles setting default values for the parser, plugins and settings properties. There is no need to manually re-declare any of these properties unless you need a different configuration for your use case.

If you include any other shareable configurations, you will need to make sure that these properties are not overwritten or modified. Otherwise, we recommend removing any configurations that share behavior with the next configuration or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin as mentioned above.
